# About

I’m a Mechanical Engineering MS student (Robotics concentration) at **Carnegie Mellon University**.  
My focus is **robot perception + control** — turning camera and sensor data into stable, precise actions on hardware.

**What I’m good at:** YOLO / Mask R‑CNN / PointNet++, ROS2, RViz, MPC/visual servoing, CAD/Ansys, Python/C++.

**What I’m exploring:** deployment‑ready vision‑to‑control stacks for industrial and medical robotics.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy building small flight payloads and debugging control loops the old‑fashioned way: one plot at a time.
